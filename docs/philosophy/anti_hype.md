# Anti-Hype Stance

AIC-DePIN explicitly rejects hype-driven development.

There are no promises of:
- Guaranteed decentralization
- Economic upside
- Infinite scalability
- Perfect security

Progress is measured by:
- Fewer assumptions
- Better failure handling
- Clearer understanding of limits

If the system cannot explain its failures,
it is not ready to grow.
