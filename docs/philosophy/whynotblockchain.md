# Why Not Blockchain

AIC-DePIN does not reject blockchain technology.
It rejects the assumption that blockchain is a universal solution.

Blockchain excels at:
- Immutable ledgers
- Asset ownership
- Permissionless value transfer

AIC-DePIN requires:
- Adaptive trust
- Reversible decisions
- Context-aware behavior
- Controlled rollback

Immutability becomes a liability
when the system must learn, adapt, and recover.

For AIC-DePIN, behavior matters more than history.
