# Why Trust Comes First

Most decentralized systems start with consensus
and attempt to derive trust from it.

AIC-DePIN reverses this order.

Trust is evaluated before influence.
Consensus is a side-effect, not a foundation.

By controlling trust:
- Damage is bounded
- Manipulation is dampened
- Recovery is possible

Without trust-first design,
decentralization amplifies failure instead of resilience.
