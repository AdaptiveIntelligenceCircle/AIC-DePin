# The Role of Humans

AIC-DePIN is not a fully autonomous system.

Humans exist to:
- Handle ambiguity
- Interrupt catastrophic escalation
- Interpret novel failure modes

Humans do not exist to:
- Grant permanent authority
- Override observed behavior
- Replace simulation and replay

Human intervention is treated as a signal,
not a command.
