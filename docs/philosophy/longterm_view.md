# Long-Term View

AIC-DePIN is designed for decades, not cycles.

The system assumes:
- Hardware will change
- Networks will fragment
- Adversaries will adapt
- Governance will be tested

Short-term optimization is treated as technical debt.

The primary goal is not dominance,
but survival with integrity.
