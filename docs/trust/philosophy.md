# Trust Philosophy

AIC-DePIN treats trust as a control signal, not a moral judgment.

Trust answers the question:
"How much influence should this behavior have right now?"

Core beliefs:
- Trust must be earned continuously
- Trust must decay naturally
- Trust must never be binary
- Trust must be observable and replayable

There is no concept of permanent trust.
