# Security Philosophy

AIC-DePIN rejects the idea of absolute trust, absolute decentralization,
or absolute safety.

Security is treated as:
- Dynamic
- Contextual
- Probabilistic
- Recoverable

We do not secure nodes.
We secure **behaviors**.

Key principles:
1. Assume breach
2. Limit blast radius
3. Detect behavior, not identity
4. Prefer rollback over prevention
5. Prefer simulation over assumptions
