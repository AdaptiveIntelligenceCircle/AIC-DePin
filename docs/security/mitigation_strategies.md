# Mitigation Strategies

AIC-DePIN prioritizes containment over prevention.

## Strategies
- Trust decay instead of trust revocation
- Progressive isolation instead of bans
- Rate-limited influence
- Behavior rollback via replay
- Multi-layer consensus dampening

Mitigations are adaptive and may evolve during runtime.
