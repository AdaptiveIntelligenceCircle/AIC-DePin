# Trust Assumptions

AIC-DePIN explicitly documents what it does and does not trust.

## Not Trusted
- Individual nodes
- Network routes
- Declared identities
- Economic incentives
- Static reputation

## Conditionally Trusted
- Observed behavior over time
- Cross-node verification
- Historical consistency
- Contextual alignment

## Trusted (Minimally)
- Cryptographic primitives
- Local execution integrity (best-effort)
- Deterministic replay logs
