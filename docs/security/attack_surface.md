# Attack Surface

Primary attack surfaces include:

## Network Layer
- Discovery protocols
- Routing decisions
- Sync timing

## Core Layer
- Policy evaluation
- Trust scoring
- Resource allocation

## Tooling
- CLI misuse
- Debug hooks
- Monitoring channels

Each surface is intentionally observable and instrumented for replay.
