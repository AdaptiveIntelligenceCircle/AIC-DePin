# Node Lifecycle

Nodes in AIC-DePIN are treated as disposable execution units,
not trusted participants.

## Lifecycle Phases
1. Registration (no inherited trust)
2. Observation
3. Conditional operation
4. Stable participation
5. Degradation
6. Isolation or retirement

Nodes may re-enter the network,
but behavior history remains relevant.
