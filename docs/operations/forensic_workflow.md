# Forensic Workflow

Forensics in AIC-DePIN relies on replay, not speculation.

## Workflow
1. Collect deterministic logs
2. Reconstruct execution state
3. Identify divergence points
4. Correlate behavior across nodes
5. Validate hypotheses via simulation

Forensics is designed for understanding,
not blame assignment.
