# Recovery

Recovery is a first-class operation in AIC-DePIN.

## Recovery Principles
- Prefer rollback over replacement
- Restore behavior before trust
- Rebuild gradually
- Assume partial compromise

## Recovery Actions
- State rollback via replay
- Trust dampening
- Policy tightening
- Progressive reintroduction of nodes

A system that cannot recover
is not secure, only brittle.
