# Replay Design

Replay is the foundation of accountability in AIC-DePIN.

All critical decisions must be:
- Logged
- Reproducible
- Re-evaluable

## Replay Capabilities
- Step-by-step state reconstruction
- Divergence detection
- Alternative policy evaluation
- Post-incident analysis

## Design Principles
- Logs are append-only
- Replay is deterministic
- Missing data is a failure

Replay allows the system to ask:
"Would we make the same decision again?"
