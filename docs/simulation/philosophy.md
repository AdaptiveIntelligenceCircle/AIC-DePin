# Simulation Philosophy

AIC-DePIN treats simulation as a primary source of truth.

Security, trust, routing, and policy decisions are not validated by assumptions, audits, or static analysis alone.
They are validated by behavior under stress.

Simulation answers one question:
"What happens when the system is pushed beyond its assumptions?"

Key beliefs:
- If it cannot be simulated, it cannot be trusted
- If it cannot fail in simulation, it will fail in production
- Real safety emerges from repeated controlled failure
