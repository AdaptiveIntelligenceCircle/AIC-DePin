# Governance Principles

AIC-DePIN governance exists to limit power, not to distribute it.

The system assumes:
- Governance mechanisms can be captured
- Voting can be manipulated
- Incentives can distort judgment

Governance is therefore:
- Minimal
- Asymmetric
- Interruptible
- Accountable via replay

Key principles:
1. Fewer decisions are better decisions
2. Most authority should be reversible
3. Automation must be overrideable
4. Governance should degrade safely under attack
