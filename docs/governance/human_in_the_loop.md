# Human-in-the-Loop

Humans are included where automation is unsafe.

Humans may:
- Intervene during anomalies
- Pause escalation
- Trigger deep replay analysis
- Apply emergency dampening

Humans may not:
- Grant permanent trust
- Override simulation results
- Bypass replay accountability

Human intervention is logged, replayable, and reviewable.
