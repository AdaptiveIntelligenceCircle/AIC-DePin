# Decision Flow

Decisions in AIC-DePIN follow a constrained path.

## Decision Types
- Operational (routing, sync, resource limits)
- Policy (trust parameters, decay rates)
- Structural (protocol changes, governance rules)

## Flow
1. Proposal creation
2. Simulation and replay evaluation
3. Limited review window
4. Conditional activation
5. Continuous observation
6. Rollback or stabilization

No decision is final without surviving real-world behavior.
