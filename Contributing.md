## Who This Project Is For

AIC-DePIN is **not optimized for mass contribution**.

It is intended for:

* System engineers
* Security researchers
* Independent infrastructure builders
* Simulation and adversarial thinkers

> If you are looking for fast or easy pull requests, this is not the right project.

## Contribution Principles

Before contributing, you are expected to:

1. Understand the philosophy, not just the code
2. Optimize for security over performance
3. Prefer clarity over cleverness
4. Simulate before deploying
5. Accept that rejection is part of safety

---

## Areas of Contribution

You may contribute to:

* Core engines (C++ / Rust)
* Simulation scenarios (Lua)
* Threat modeling and adversarial analysis
* Formal documentation and specifications
* Code review with security focus

---

## Development Workflow

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a clearly scoped branch
3. Implement changes with tests and simulations
4. Attach a threat or risk analysis
5. Open a pull request

Pull requests may be rejected if they:

* Increase attack surface
* Violate trust or security assumptions
* Add unnecessary dependencies
* Optimize convenience over safety

---

## Coding Standards

* Explicit is better than implicit
* No hidden state
* No magic behavior
* Comment **why**, not just **what**
* Security-relevant logic must be obvious

---

## Governance and Decision Making

* No fixed roadmap
* Major changes require simulation and small-scale consensus
* Maintainers retain the right to **veto changes for safety reasons**

---

## Ethics and Responsibility

By contributing, you acknowledge:

* Your code may influence real infrastructure
* The project is not designed for personal profit
* Weaponization of AIC-DePIN is unacceptable

> This is infrastructure.
> Treat it accordingly.
